    <h3>What is the Electoral College?</h3>
    <p>Unlike what it sounds like, the <b>Electoral College</b> is a group of people, not a building.
    Made up of 528 delegates, (One for each member in the House of Representatives, plus two Senators.)the Electoral College is no small organization.
    The role the <b>Electoral College</b> has is not only felt at the state level, but also on the national level as well.
    When it is time to elect a new President and Vice President of the United States, the elected representatives from each state gather.
    It is their job to represent the people from their district, and to cast their vote based on the majority in said district.
    Now, there are several cases when the representative strayed from this action, but most of the time the rep. will follow this protocol.
    The <b>Electoral College</b> meets on the first monday after the second wednesday in December.
    It is during that time they cast their votes, and hopefully represent the people they were elected to represent.
